# Changelog

User-facing changes for each release. Every app upgrade adds a new entry here.

Release sections can use a leading `> …` blockquote for the headline summary.
List cross-platform changes first under `###` headings (e.g. POPUP & SETTINGS,
SELECTORS), then platform-specific notes under:

`### BY PLATFORM`

- `#### Safari (Mac)` — Mac Safari extension + Mac companion / Mac App Store
- `#### Safari (iOS)` — iOS Safari extension + iOS companion / iOS App Store
- `#### Chrome`
- `#### Firefox`
- `#### Edge`

Bullets use `- **Short title.** Longer description.`
Omit empty platform buckets rather than leaving placeholders.

Store What’s New generators (`scripts/changelog-to-store-whats-new.js`) include
shared `###` sections plus the matching `####` platform bucket. They skip
`- **Version:** …` lines and release-engineering notes.

Canonical headings (aliases accepted by the generator: Safari (macOS), Safari
macOS, iOS, macOS, etc.):

| Heading | Meaning | Store What’s New / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared `### …` | All browsers/apps | Mac + iOS App Store; Firefox AMO notes |
| `#### Safari (Mac)` | Mac Safari + Mac App Store | Mac App Store only |
| `#### Safari (iOS)` | iOS Safari + iOS App Store | iOS App Store only |
| `#### Chrome` | Chrome Web Store | Package upload only (no public What’s New API) |
| `#### Firefox` | Firefox Add-ons | AMO `release_notes` (`en-GB`) |
| `#### Edge` | Edge Add-ons | Edge package upload only (cert notes skipped) |

## v6.8.0

> Delay before opening sites, redirect rules, accessibility polish, and popup
> improvements.

### DELAY OPENING DISTRACTING WEBSITES

- **Delay before a site opens.** Take a breath and consider your intention
  online by choosing to delay opening certain websites. Toggle it per site
  from the Custom section.
- **Configurable delay length.** Choose a delay between 5 and 600 seconds
  (default 10).
- **Shared unlock / delay message.** The Settings “Unlock / delay message”
  appears on both the unlock countdown and the delay screen (default:
  “What's your intention?”).

### REDIRECTS TO ANOTHER PAGE OR WEBSITE

- **Redirects when you open a website.** Redirect yourself to either another
  page on the website via a relative link (e.g. `/feed/subscriptions`) or to
  another website (e.g. wikipedia.org). Toggle and add a redirect for the
  current website from the Custom section.
- **Redirects at a glance.** See active redirects to your current page. Edit
  or delete them as you wish.
- **Infinite redirect protection.** Redirects from site A to site B will not
  be allowed if there is already a redirect from site B to site A.

### POPUP & SETTINGS

- **Accessibility improvements.** Extension-wide improvements for keyboard-only
  users.
- **Collapsible Custom section.** Custom collapses by default on sites that
  already have pre-configured hide options, and expands by default on other
  sites; the open/closed state is remembered per site.
- **Custom section chrome.** Eyebrow and chevron alignment cleaned up for the
  collapsible Custom header.
- **Theme (was Appearance).** Settings rename Appearance → Theme, with a
  chevron control and a tighter hit target on the selector.
- **UK greyscale spelling.** Greyscale uses the UK spelling consistently.
- **Secondary text spacing.** Line spacing and size for helper copy (e.g.
  YouTube preview tips) are easier to read when text wraps.

### BY PLATFORM

#### Safari (iOS)

- **Numeric keyboard for number fields.** Delay and similar numeric inputs use
  the numeric keyboard where appropriate.
- **Sheet no longer jumps to full height.** Typing in popup inputs no longer
  forces the iOS sheet to expand to its maximum height.

### RELEASE

- **Version:** 6.8.0 (Safari Mac, Safari iOS, Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## v6.7.0

> Bug fixes, popup polish, and Digital Habits: Blocker allowlist alignment.

### BRANDING & POPUP

- **Centre for Digital Habits branding.** Updated branding copy to Centre for
  Digital Habits, with footer attribution to digitalhabits.org.
- **Review prompt and footer restyle.** Restyled the review prompt and footer,
  and made the Add/Edit CSS selector editor a full-bleed panel like Settings.
- **Stable popup width and typography.** Stabilized popup width and typography
  across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (fixed 310px width, consistent root font
  size).
- **Extension pages are not websites.** Extension and internal browser pages are
  no longer treated as websites (avoids showing the Safari extension UUID as a
  site name).

### BY PLATFORM

#### Safari (Mac)

- **Popup scrolls when selectors overflow.** Main popup content now scrolls when
  selectors overflow the popup height (previously clipped with no scroll).
- **Scrollbar gutter for lock/settings.** Classic scrollbar gutter so the
  lock/settings buttons no longer overlap the scrollbar.
- **Leave a review opens the store reliably.** "Leave a review" ships
  `review_store_url.js` in the extension bundle and opens the store via
  `tabs.create` (fixes missing-script errors).
- **Allowlist enforcement matches desktop.** Fixed inverted allowlist enforcement
  for Safari users on the extension blocking method (allowed sites were blocked;
  now matches desktop Automation / Rust host behaviour, including one-shot
  schedules).

#### Safari (iOS)

- **Sticky footer in the popup sheet.** Popup sheet scrolls content with a sticky
  footer that stays visible and does not grow when the sheet is expanded.
- **Leave a review opens the store reliably.** "Leave a review" ships
  `review_store_url.js` and opens the store via `tabs.create` (fixes
  missing-script errors and iOS popup self-navigation / UUID glitch).
- **Open Safari to get started stays in Safari.** iOS companion app always opens
  `x-safari-https` instead of handing off to the YouTube app when installed.
- **Allowlist enforcement matches desktop.** Fixed inverted allowlist enforcement
  for Safari users on the extension blocking method (allowed sites were blocked;
  now matches desktop Automation / Rust host behaviour, including one-shot
  schedules).

#### Chrome

- **Scrollbar gutter for lock/settings.** Classic scrollbar gutter so the
  lock/settings buttons no longer overlap the scrollbar.

### RELEASE

- **Version:** 6.7.0 (Safari Mac, Safari iOS, Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
